# SwissSystem

The code operates through a user-accessible loop, offering various functionalities via a menu system.
 Users can add players, view standings, generate pairs, display pairings, add points, or conclude the tournament.
 The Swiss System's fairness principles ensure equitable competition, pairing players based on comparable points.
 Additionally, special handling is provided for odd player counts, with the player having the fewest points taking a break in the round while receiving a point for participation.
It's worth noting that pairs cannot be repeated throughout the tournament, ensuring that players face different opponents in each round. 
Furthermore, the player who takes a break can only do so once during the tournament, maintaining fairness and equal opportunity for all participants.
